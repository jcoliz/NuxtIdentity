# Local provider sample

This sample is a .NET Aspire app demonstrating:

Frontend

* Running Nuxt 4
* Generated code
* With @sidebase/nuxt-auth
* Recommended configuration of local provider for calling a backend running NuxtIdentity.
* Good-looking professional-quality UI
* Demonstrates only the auth capabilities of the backend
* Custom UI we control, so don't have to rely on external repo for front end

Backend

* .NET Web API
* Using NuxtIdentity
* Bare minimum functionality, just the auth backend APIs
